# traefik examples

In this repo I want to report my experiences with [traefik](https://docs.traefik.io/) in my home network. All the configurations (if possible) are made with [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) so you have fewer places where you have to make changes.

In my network I need some services and the most are on `docker` but with the change that browsers don't like `http` anymore, I need a way to configure `httpS` for all the services and I don't like to remember the port for every specific site. The solution is a reverse proxy and I have found with `traefik` a nice solution.


## Getting Started

### Examples

All this examples are based on traefik **version 2.x**.

- **basic**: installation of traefik with SSL trough Let's Encrypt
- **oauth**: use OAuth to protect a site with Google login
- **fileprovider**: connect trough traefik a server not in docker
- **dashboard**: dashboard connection with `api.insecure=false`
- **authelia**: SSO and 2FA with a local server
- **tcp**: TCP entry point for non HTTP services
- **mTLS**: securing services with mutual TLS (mTLS)
- **Guacamole**: installing guide for Guacamole
- **Ping**: check the traefik status with an http ping
- **Nextcloud**: personal office online with ONLYOFFICE
- **network segregation**: segment the traffic of containers
- **multiple domains**: multi domain pointing to a single container


### Installing

1. For each example there is a separate folder, copy this files to your machine.

2. In the root directory of this repo there is a variable file `var.env`. Download it and rename in `.env`. The most configurations options specific for your installation are in this file. You can copy it to every example you want to try.

3. In the `docker-compose.yml` you find all the configuration to generate and configure the docker containers.

4. In every example folder you find a `README.md` with a guide to the relative case.
